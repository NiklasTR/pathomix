Both trastuzumab and paclitaxel are used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but patients can develop resistance. The link between PI3K mutations and trastuzumab resistance has been seen in breast cancer patients. This suggests that inhibitors of the PI3K/PTEN pathway may have the potential to restore sensitivity to trastuzumab. Similarly, introduction of activated mutant forms of PI3K has been shown to transform and confer paclitaxel resistance to immortalized breast epithelial cells.

The purpose of this study is to explore the benefit, for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), of a regimen in which participants begin treatment with either of these two taxane drugs (docetaxel or cabazitaxel, in combination with prednisone) and are switched to the other taxane drug if prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value does not decrease ≥30% after 4 cycles. As defined in study protocol amendment 3, efficacy results are summarized for all participants combined, irrespective of which agent (docetaxel or cabazitaxel) was administered initially, rather than separately for the two groups based on taxane administered initially. One of the primary outcome measures is percentage of participants with a ≥50% sustained decrease from baseline in PSA at any time during the trial. By providing an opportunity for patients to switch taxane based on early PSA response, there may be a difference in result for this measure versus result in a study where it was not possible to switch. The other primary outcome measures are change from baseline in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) biomarkers percent androgen receptor nuclear localization (%ARNL) and microtubule bundling (MTB).",2013,3,Phase 2,['Prostate Cancer Metastatic'],63,Completed,['Prostatic Neoplasms'],Prostatic Neoplasms

All of the drugs that will be received in this research study have been approved in the United States for colorectal cancer, that has spread to other areas of the body, including the liver. Another reason for doing this study is to see if the chemotherapy drugs FOLFIFI plus Bevacizumab can sufficiently decrease the size of the cancer in the liver so that any tumor remaining can be completely removed with surgery and, if it can be removed whether doing so will prolong the time it takes the cancer to return and/or prolong the life of these patients.

The rationale for investigating everolimus in advanced NSCLC previously treated with chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus EGFR inhibitors, like gefitinib or erlotinib, is based on following: - The medical need for the better therapy for advanced NSCLC and limited efficacy of the currently available therapy in advanced NSCLC. - Postulated association of relevant cell-signaling pathways targeted by everolimus with different aspects of oncogenesis, disease progression, and response/resistance to treatment. - Effectiveness of everolimus and rapamycin in preclinical models of lung cancer - Early reports of clinical responses to monotherapy with mTOR inhibitors in advanced NSCLC. There is evidence that an enhanced PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which is inhibited by everolimus, may be one of the key changes accounting for different aspects of oncogenesis, disease progression, and response/resistance to NSCLC cancer treatment. The use of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in treatment of advanced NSCLC would be a novel therapeutic approach that proposes to logically manipulate the cell's regulatory pathways to enable control of tumor growth.",2005,7,Phase 2,['Non-small-cell Lung Carcinoma'],85,Completed,"['Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms']","Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung"

Novartis,NCT00241046.xml,Letrozole in the Treatment of 1st and 2nd Line Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer: Pre-therapeutic Risk Assessment,"The course of the disease in female patients with metastatic mammary carcinoma can vary greatly. In this connection, the individual prognosis depends on a complex interaction of tumor- and patient-related factors. To take account of such differences, it is necessary to employ individual methods of treatment which are suited to the course of each patient's disease. Prof. Possinger and Dr. Schmid (Charite Berlin) and Prof. Wischnewsky (University of Bremen) have developed an approach that can help to achieve this goal with the aid of computerized machine learning techniques (MLT). The use of machine learning methods can be beneficial in oncology in two respects. On the one hand, an attempt can be made to individually estimate clinically relevant parameters like, for example, the recurrence probability or expected survival time as precisely as possible based on the established prognostic factors. And on the other hand, it may be possible with the aid of MLT to understand structural relationships between the clinical result and measured or established tumor-/patient-related variables. To analyze the possible benefits of machine learning techniques for patients with metastatic breast cancer, the aim of study FEM-D-2 is to investigate whether it is possible to characterize those patients who either do or do not respond to a specific treatment with a precision of 90%, prospectively estimate the time until worsening of the disease under a given treatment, and classify patients in groups with favorable and poor chances of medium-term survival. The use of inductive learning algorithms with machine learning also makes it possible to very accurately estimate the time until progression of the tumor growth. In patients who respond to letrozole therapy, the time until tumor progression depends on factors like pain, age, body mass index, disease-free interval, main localization of metastatic spread, and response to previous estrogen therapy.

The median survival for patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST is approximately 20 months, and for patients with local recurrence it is 9 to 12 months. Responses to chemotherapy have been at best 5%. The introduction of imatinib has dramatically changed the prognosis of these patients yielding response rates between 41% and 71% and an overall clinical benefit (tumor responses plus stable disease) ranging between 73% and 90%. However, resistance to imatinib may develop and represents a further clinical challenge. Sunitinib has recently been approved by the FDA for patients whose disease has progressed or who are intolerant to imatinib therapy. Patients with tumor progressing on sunitinib or another 2nd line agent have limited therapeutic alternatives. Reinstitution of imatinib, if possible, is considered an acceptable option for these patients because it may slow the rate of disease progression even in the setting of prior imatinib failure; however a more optimal 3rd line treatment is needed. AMN107 is a novel aminopyrimidine, available as an oral formulation that is ATP -competitive inhibitor of BCR-ABL,more potent than Imatinib. It inhibits proliferation and autophosphorylation of 32 out of 33 BCR-ABL point mutations. In addition AMN107 also inhibits PDGFRα,PDGFRβ, and KIT. Preliminary data from an ongoing Phase I study in imatinib-resistant GIST patients (CAMN107A2103) indicate that AMN107 alone (400 mg BID) and in combination with imatinib (imatinib 400 mg BID plus AMN107 200 mg QD and 400 mg QD) is well tolerated in this pre-treated patients.",2008,6,Phase 2,['Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST)'],9,Completed,['Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors'],Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors

Novartis,NCT00667251.xml,"A Randomized, Open-Label, Phase III Study of Taxane Based Chemotherapy With Lapatinib or Trastuzumab as First-Line Therapy for Women With HER2/Neu Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer","RATIONALE: HER2/neu is a receptor (protein) which is found in unusually high amounts in approximately 1 in 5 cancer patients. Scientific evidence suggests that having high amounts of the HER2/neu receptor is important for breast cancer to grow and spread. Women with previously untreated metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread to other organs) and with high levels of the HER2/neu receptor receive as their usual treatment chemotherapy with one of the approved chemotherapy drugs paclitaxel or docetaxel (called \""taxanes\"") together with another approved drug called \""trastuzumab\"". Chemotherapy drugs, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, work either by killing tumour cells or by stopping them from dividing. Trastuzumab is an antibody that is given through a vein in the arm and it works by specifically \""targeting\"" the HER2/neu i.e. it attaches to it and \""turns it off\"". Although some of the patients who receive this taxane plus trastuzumab treatment feel better for some months, the cancer usually starts to grow again. Lapatinib is a new drug. Like trastuzumab, it also works by specifically \""targeting\"" the HER2/neu receptor, but it does so in a different way. Lapatinib is not an antibody. It is a pill that is taken daily by mouth. Because lapatinib works in a different way than trastuzumab, it may be worse, as good as or better than trastuzumab in keeping metastatic HER/neu positive cancer from growing. However, this is not known. Purpose: This randomized Phase III trial is comparing chemotherapy (a taxane) given together with lapatinib with chemotherapy (a taxane) given together with trastuzumab in women with HER2/neu positive breast cancer.",2008,10,Phase 3,['Breast Cancer'],649,"Active, not recruiting",['Breast Neoplasms'],Breast Neoplasms

Novartis,NCT01172548.xml,"A Multi-center, Single Arm, Phase II Study of Adjuvant Imatinib (Glivec®) in Patients Following the Resection of Primary Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor ( GIST)","GISTs are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. Approximately 95% of GISTs are positive for KIT (CD117)-the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF). GISTs are not responsive to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and disease often recurs even after complete resection with wide margins. Imatinib mesylate (trade names: Glivec® and Gleevec®, imatinib, formerly STI571) is a signal transduction inhibitor targeting several protein-tyrosine kinases that are believed to play a role in the proliferation of tumor cells. In the Phase II study of imatinib [CSTI571B 2222] in 147 patients with recurrent or metastatic GIST, the partial response rates were 67% and 66% in patients treated at 400 mg/d and 600 mg/d, respectively. Skin rash and elevated transaminases were the most common reason for drug discontinuation. The most frequently reported AEs were mild nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, superficial edema (primarily periorbital or lower limb), myalgia and muscle cramps. Grade 3/4 events included fluid retention (pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites, and pulmonary edema), skin rash, liver toxicity and gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage. Myelosuppression (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) was a consistent finding. Also, a tumor lysis-like syndrome occurred in some patients leading to gastrointestinal (GI) and/or intratumoral hemorrhage. In a Phase 3, American College of Surgeons Oncology Group trial (ACOSOG Z9001) of adjuvant imatinib, imatinib significantly improved 1-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared with placebo. In summary, clinical trials have shown that imatinib produces clinical benefit in most patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST and extends median survival from 19 to 57 months. Imatinib is the standard of care for advanced GIST and has received regulatory approval for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic GIST. Studies suggest that adjuvant imatinib for 1 year prolongs RFS in patients at high risk of recurrent disease and metastases following complete surgical resection of the primary GIST. Imatinib is an appealing adjuvant therapy for resected GIST because: 1. Patients with primary GIST have a high chance of tumor recurrence 2. Conventional adjuvant treatment modalities are ineffective 3. Imatinib specifically inhibits the Kit receptor which is constitutively activated in most GISTs 4. Imatinib inhibits the growth of Kit positive cells in vitro 5. Imatinib is highly effective in many patients with advanced GIST in a Phase II trial 6. Imatinib has been associated with minimal toxicity in patients with advanced GIST and in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) 7.

Novartis,NCT01206764.xml,"An Open-label, Multi-center Phase 2 Study to Evaluate Everolimus as Monotherapy Treatment for Patients With Metastatic Recurrent and/or Unresectable Renal Cell Carcinoma (EVERMORE).","Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for more than 200,000 new cases of cancer and over 100,000 cancer deaths annually in the World (Ferlay, et al., 2004). It is estimated that there were about 15,000 new cases of RCC in the region that excludes the Americas, European Union and Japan. Renal cell carcinomas arise from the proximal tubal epithelium are more common in males than in females with an overall lifetime risk of 1 in 75 and a median age of diagnosis of 65 years. Everolimus (Certican®) has been approved since 2003 in more than 60 countries for the prevention of organ rejection in patients with renal and cardiac transplantation. Everolimus (RAD001) is a derivative of rapamycin, which acts as a signal transduction inhibitor. It targets mTOR, a key protein kinase regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival. The mTOR pathway activity is modulated by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B AKT (AKT) pathway, a pathway known to be deregulated in numerous human cancers. RAD001 (Afinitor®) has been investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act: - directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation; - indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity (via potent inhibition of tumor cell hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activity, VEGF production, and VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells). Primary: To evaluate the PFS rate over time. Secondary: - To evaluate the disease control rate (stable disease [SD] + partial response [PR] + complete response [CR]); - To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR; where ORR = CR + PR) and duration; - To describe the safety profile of RAD001.",2010,4,Phase 4,['Renal Cell Carcinoma'],110,Recruiting,"['Carcinoma', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell']","Carcinoma, Renal Cell"

These subjects will be eligible for randomization to intravenous cetuximab maintenance therapy with either 500 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) every 2 weeks or 250 mg/m^2 weekly (q1w); about 240 subjects are expected per group. The trial will be performed in a community practice setting, with approximately 230 centers participating in the trial worldwide (planned countries are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom and Venezuela). With noncompetitive enrollment, approximately 4 to 8 subjects are expected to be enrolled at each center. Enrollment in the individual centers is generally limited to a maximum of 8 subjects. If any of these subjects does not receive trial treatment for any reason or discontinue all trial treatment at the first visit, additional subjects may be enrolled until 8 subjects were treated. The primary endpoint of the trial will be overall survival time from inclusion into the trial to death. Additional secondary efficacy endpoints will be time to treatment failure, tumor response, and disease control rate. Other endpoints will include safety and toxicity, compliance with maintenance therapy, subject satisfaction and translational research (TR) (for subjects with tumor samples available).",2009,1,Phase 3,['Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)'],583,Completed,"['Lung Neoplasms', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung']",Lung Neoplasms

Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab (Bv) may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether giving combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab is more effective than combination chemotherapy alone in treating colon cancer in adjuvant setting.
